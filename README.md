This repo contains some data exploration I did with SQL as well as the datasets I used for the exploration in case you'd like to try out the project yourself.

This repo contains:

# Data exploration with Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio(SSMS)

![](Covid19.jpg)

The start of COVID-19 in 2019 caused big changes in health, society, the economy, and nature. These changes keep affecting us every day and might last a long time.
For this project, I analyzed and explored the global COVID-19 pandemic data in SSMS. 

The data was sourced from [Our world in data](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths). View my codes [here](https://github.com/JachimmaChristian/SQL-Projects-Repo/blob/main/Covid%2019%20Portfolio%20Project1%20-%20Christian%20Jachimma%20C..SQL)

**SQL Skills demonstrated:** Joins, CTEs, Temp Tables, Windows Functions, Aggregate Functions, Creating Views, Converting Data Types

# Cleaning Nashville Housing Data In Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)

# Data Exploration in Google Bigquery
For this project I explored Ecommerce data to understand user behaviour, product engagement, and the effectiveness of the platform's checkout process, aiming to derive insights that could potentially inform business strategies and optimizations within the Ecommerce domain using Bigquery's standard SQL.

**Skills Demonstrated:** Duplicate Records Identification, Aggregate Functions and counting, Grouping and Sorting, String Manipulation and substring Functions, Limiting Results and filtering, Case Statements and Conditional Logic, Joins and subqueries, Data Aggregation and calculation,  Advanced Query Logic.
